# Example Chat Site

This is a simple chat site that uses Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Installation and Usage

1. Navigate to the site directory:
   ```bash
   cd site
   ```

2. Install dependencies (I recommend using pnpm)
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the site.
